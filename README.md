# Daisi's .Net SDK
This is the .Net 10 SDK for interacting with the DAISI network.

Documentation available on [our website](https://daisi.ai/Learn/SDK).

Quickstart Guide is [here](https://daisi.ai/Learn/SDK/dotnet/QuickStart).

Nuget install with Package Manager Console:

```
Install-Package Daisi.SDK
```

# Examples
The example Console app is meant to show the bare minimum needed to get started. Should give a simple Basic thinking chat in a console window. This was moved into this project from it's own repo to make it easier to keep it up to date with the SDK changes.
